This app compares various autocomplete apps for Django
======================================================

Item app
--------

We have 2 Users:

- jpic with password testjpic
- john with user testjohn

We have 2 Items, which serve as root for subitems of their related user:

- "jpic root item" with owner jpic,
- "john root item" with owner john,

We want users to be able to create and update Items which must have a parent
that belongs to them. The specification is simple: jpic should not see "john
root item" or any item belonging to john anywhere.

To get started, authenticate as "jpic" in http://localhost:8000/admin

Then, try the autocomplete-light form http://localhost:8000/item/al/create/ or
the select2 form http://localhost:8000/item/s2/create/
